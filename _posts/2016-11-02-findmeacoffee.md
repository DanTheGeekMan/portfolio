Find Me A Coffee enables users to find coffee shops in their local area and locate themselves on the map.  This was achieved using Google Maps API and is a mobile responsive single page web app.  Technologies used include MongoDB NoSQL database, the Express backend framework, Node.js cross platform JavaScript runtime environment and the Bootstrap v4 CSS framework.  The backend is coded in Javascript ES6 and transpiled to ES5.  The build tool used is Grunt and the Object Orientated Programming paradigm has been utilised.

The map, map controls and map markers have been customized. Modals have been used for the menu options.  This is an extremely slick design with no interface clutter.
