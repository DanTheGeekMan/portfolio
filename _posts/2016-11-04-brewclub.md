BrewClub enables users to join ‘BrewClubs’ and share drink preferences, enabling simplified drink ordering for groups. This was achieved by developing a single page mobile responsive web app implemented using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express backend framework, Angular frontend framework & Node.js environment) and using the Bootstrap v4 CSS framework.  As a solo project.  Using JWT authentication, this solo project consisted of two data models, with an API with 6 endpoints extending from the 7 RESTful routes.  The vision for this project was to be a module which could be integrated with other applications at a later stage.
