Delivery Rescue; Crash Bandicoot Twist is a JavaScript side scrolling game.  The objective is to save as many delivery crates as you can.  It might just be me, but it is quite addictive.  Give it a try using the link above.    

This was my first project.  Delivery Rescue is largely written with the jQuery library. I’m still impressed with it and I’m pleased it is using the Object Orientated Programming paradigm. Collision detection was a particular problem to solve in this game.  The solution was great fun.  If you’re tired and needing sleep I can talk you through it.

The font is Google Fonts ‘Bree Serif’.

What most impressed my glass mates was the scrolling background. I look forward to creating more games in the future.
