SwishList enables users to trade clothing for free (swishing) following the principles of the sharing economy. This was achieved by developing a single page mobile responsive web app implemented using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express backend framework, Angular frontend framework & Node.js environment) and using the Bootstrap v4 CSS framework. SwishList used JWT authentication and consisted of three data models, with an API that consisted of 9 endpoints extending from the 7 RESTful routes. The transaction process required two users and two products per transaction, increasing the complexity for a project of this size due to product/user interactions requiring extensive Mongoose validation logic which made the project a personal achievement. As a team project, our four-man-band equally contributed to the design and development of the site. My main responsibility was the Test-driven development environment using the Mocha framework, structuring the manual user testing, and design and implementation of the API.
