			<h2>Want to know more about me</h2>
		</header>
		<p>I'm a junior web developer, with a past as a systems administrator of Linux and Windows systems.  I have worked in IT in some way shape or form for over 10 years.  You name it, I've probably done it; field engineer, tech support and systems administrator.</p>

		<p>I took the decision to become a web developer, changing the direction of my life and put myself on the path to achieve my dream: creating tools that solve peoples problems. I am focused on problem-solving challenges. I am looking for a position that will test my abilities and where I will have to grow to succeed. I am looking not only for exciting touch problems to solve but also an energetic team to work with, learn from and share my knowledge with. Within the next 5 years, my goal is to become a domain expert, while mentoring those around me and encouraging them to step up and do the same.</p>

		<p>Get in touch or find out more about me using the icons below. I am available on Twitter and feel free to browse my projects on GitHub and view my profile and get in touch on LinkedIn.</p>

		<p>As always, my work is made with love.</p>
